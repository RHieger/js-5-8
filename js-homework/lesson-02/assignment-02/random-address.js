/* Generate random addresses!
 *
 * For this Iâ€™d like you to:
 *
 * Create a new array containing dummy data for Street, City, State.
 * Now each time you run the script, it should print a new randomly generated 
 * address from the arrays and random numbers for street numbers.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * node random-address.js
 * => 34578 Dolphin Street, Wonka NY, 44506
 *
 * As a bonus, randomly include an apartment number (so sometimes an address 
 * has an apartment while others do not).
 *

 // MY SOLUTION:

 // NOTE REGARDING BONUS:
 //
 // Not sure if my solution to the bonus is technically cheating. I was unable
 // to think of another solution but simply including elements within the array
 // that also had apartment numbers. However, including such elements within
 // the array might be interpreted as violating DRY principles.
 //
 // Nonetheless, the solution does work.
