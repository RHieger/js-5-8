# Homework

For this homework, we're going to piece together a lot of the information that we have learned.

## Acceptance Criteria

Create an HTML file and Javascript file. In the HTML file include the javascript using the `<script>` tag that covered in class.

On the page, there should be an input field that accepts numbers and a button that says "Go!".

So take this scenario:

> Given I enter in "10" into the input box
>
> When I click "Go!"
>
> Then the fizz buzz algorithm is printed under the box up to "10"

Things to consider:

* When retrieving a value from an input element in Javascript, the value will be returned as a string. You'll need to convert the value to the integer type. Google away :)
* When someone enters in a _new_ number and presses Go!, then the previous result should be erased and replaced with the new value.
